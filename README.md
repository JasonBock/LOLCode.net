# LOLCode.net
A [LOLCODE](http://www.lolcode.org/) compiler written in .NET.

## Overview
This is code originally written by [Nick Johnson](http://blog.notdot.net/) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson)). The archive of this code can be found [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/lolcode-dot-net/). [He's given me permission](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1081424860876746752) to host this code in a repo, so that's why this exist. For now, the first commit will be the code pretty much as-is with very little changes (the only one I did was handling exceptions in tests). After that, I'll start to change/modernize as needed.
